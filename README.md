# MLGL Renderer

This is originally a final project for my Computer Graphics course, and later I decided to keep working on it and added a lot new features.

This will also my last renderer implemented in OpenGL. Later I'll learn Vulkan and use that as the primary Graphics API I'm going to use.

These are some features that this project support

* Shadowmap

* Skeletal&Morph Animation

* Skybox

* PBR

* Real-time global illumination based on RSM.

Since I didn't decide publishing this before, I didn't keep track on all the third party resources I used. If you find the dependencies
or resource of this project is infringing your or other's copyright, please contact me through my email: [oppositenormal@outlook.com](oppositenormal@outlook.com)

Some rendering results are shown bellow:
